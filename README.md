# Rules

This Swift project is inspired by previous designs of rule engines in Java. Those engines were driven to a greater or lesser extent by the *Dynamic Object Model* pattern.
The goal of this project is to design a rule model that relies as much as possible on the rich (and sometimes quirky) Swift type system.

## Status: In progress

# Expression model

## Core expression model

## Predicates

## Functions

## Context model

### Key paths

# Rule model

# Engine

# Rule DSL and function builders

# Requirements

The code has been tested with the Swift 5.1 and XCode 11.2.1.
